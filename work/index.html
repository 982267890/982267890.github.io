						I participated in the Chicago Furniture Show (Casual Market Chicago) sales experience in my
						spare time.
						The exhibition lasted for three days. The exhibit item I was responsible for was an electric
						lift computer desk. Since the product itself has a small audience, in the end, through my
						personal efforts,
						I sold a total of Sold two orders.</span>

				<span>
					<span>I had more than 80 hours of volunteer service experience in
						high school,
						of which volunteering in churches and aid stations were the most frequent,
						accounting for more than half. And what I personally think is the most meaningful
						is that another Jewish community service was provided to survivors of two World War
						II concentration camps. Especially the first one was a blind man. I talked a lot with
						him and listened to him talk about a lot of personal experiences. Benefited a lot.</span>
